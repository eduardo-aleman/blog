## Important Note

A Nano node stores the entire ledger of transactions. While the Nano team is experimenting with pruning (removing historical data to reduce disk space), the primary way to manage storage for a Nano node is by ensuring you have enough space available on your SSD-based hard drive.

## Current Storage Requirements

- Principal Representative Nodes (more than 0.1% of online voting weight): Require 400GB+ of free space on an SSD.

- Non-voting and Regular Representative Nodes: Also require 400GB+ of free space on an SSD.

## Pruning (Experimental)

Ledger pruning allows for the removal of blocks that are not account frontiers (the latest state of an account). The goal is to reduce the ledger size, but the pruning feature is currently experimental and not for production use. Pruning requires a full ledger to be bootstrapped initially. Pruned nodes can still serve as bootstrap servers for remaining blocks. Note that pruning is not available for voting nodes.

### Configuration

Nano node configuration is typically managed through TOML configuration files. Specific settings for disk space limits or pruning, if available, would be found within these configuration files.

For details on specific pruning parameters (like min-retain-blocks), you would consult the relevant documentation or configuration files (e.g., app.toml in some cases).

In summary, to manage hard drive limits for a Nano node, you primarily focus on providing sufficient SSD storage based on the recommended requirements. The experimental pruning feature is an ongoing development to reduce storage needs, but currently, it is not recommended for production nodes.

## üê≥ Installing Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -and ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release


# Clave GPG
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
 sudo gpg --dearmor -the /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg


# Repository for Ubuntu 24.04 (noble)
echo \
 "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
 noble stable" | \
 sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null


# Final installation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

---

## üì¶ Nano Container Configuration

```bash
mkdir -p ~/nano-node-docker
cd ~/nano-node-docker
```

### `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  nano_node:
    image: nanocurrency/nano:V28.1
    container_name: nano_node
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7075:7075/tcp"
      - "7075:7075/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/root/Nano
```

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

---

## üîê Wallet and account import

### 1. Access the container

```bash
sudo docker exec -it nano_node bash
```

### 2. Create wallet

```bash
nano_node --wallet_create
# Result:
# 4D...
```

### 3. Import seed

```bash
nano_node --wallet_change_seed \
 --wallet=4D... \
 --seed=P6AD...
```

### 4. Create a derivative account (from the seed)

```bash
nano_node --account_create \
 --wallet=4D...


# Result:
# nano_7...
```

---

## üó≥Ô∏è Set up an account as a Representative

```bash
nano_node --wallet_representative_set \
 --wallet=4D... \
 --account=nano_7...
```

```bash
nano_node --account_representative_set \
 --account=nano_7... \
 --representative=nano_7...
```

---

## üíæ Manual backup of the `wallets.ldb` file

```bash
cp ~/nano-node-docker/data/Nano/wallets.ldb ~/wallets-backup.ldb
```

---

## üß™ Node Verification

```bash
sudo docker logs -f nano_node
sudo docker exec -it nano_node bash
nano_node --diagnostics
```

---

## üìå Notes

-The imported wallet is fully functional within the node.
-The account is already registered as a representative.
-The file`wallets.ldb`contains all the keys derived from the seed.

---

## Appendix: Manual verification of the Nano node

### ‚úÖ 1. Verify that the container is running

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

It should display a line like:

```
nanocurrency/nano:V28.1   ...   Up XX minutes ...   nano_node
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. View logs in real time

```bash
sudo docker logs -f nano_node
```

You should see:

```
[monitor] [info] Blocks confirmed: ...
[monitor] [info] Peers: ...
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Check connectivity and diagnostics

```bash
sudo docker exec -it nano_node bash
nano_node --diagnostics
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. View number of blocks

```bash
nano_node --debug_block_count
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. View list of connected peers

```bash
nano_node --debug_peers
```

Expected output:

```
[::ffff:178.33.122.56]:7075
[::ffff:51.81.243.15]:7075
```

# üß≠ Manual Verification of the Nano Node

Last updated: 2025-06-05 03:37:44

Manually verify that the node is up, without scripts or external monitoring.

| No. | Command                                                                          | What it checks                            | Expected result                              |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `sudo docker ps`                                                                 | That the container is running             | Line with`nano_node`and state`Up`            |
| 2   | `sudo docker exec -it nano_node tail -n 20 /root/Nano/log/node.log`              | That the node is generating recent logs   | Recent lines with activity (`monitor`, etc.) |
| 3   | `sudo docker exec -it nano_node grep Peers /root/Nano/log/node.log \| tail -n 1` | That the node is connected to other nodes | Something like`Peers: 166 (inbound: 72 ...)` |

---

## üìù Recommendation

Perform this review at least **once a day** if you don't have automatic supervision.

---

These checks ensure that the node is:
-‚úÖ Synchronized
-‚úÖ Connected
-‚úÖ Operational
-‚úÖ Active on the Nano network
